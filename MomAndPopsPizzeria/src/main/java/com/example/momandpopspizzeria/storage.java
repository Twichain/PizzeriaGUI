//this class is where all the information will be stored. im going to do arraylists for everything just because they are easy to work with.
//we are storing EVERYTHING in arraylists that way we can access every part of the solution the same way for efficiency.

//maybe i can make this into a hash instead of an array list.
public class storage {
    //attributes
    //array list for customer accounts
    //array list for employee accounts
    //array list for main order menu items
    //array list for toppings
    //array list for sides
    //array list for pizza sizes
    //array list for buttons
    //array list for beverage sizes
    //array list for beverages
